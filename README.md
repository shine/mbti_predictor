## Overview
There is so called [Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) (MBTI) that divides people in 16 categories based on 4 parameters with 2 possible values in each param. Here is my version of prediction logic based on previously trained bag of words. You are passing text written by some person and as result you are getting MBTI type of that person.
